### LawnLab Automatic Lawn Fertilizer Robot Project

The LawnLab Robot is a robot that uses a GPS RTK Positioning system to traverse and dispense fertilizer throughout a certain area.
The system has two parts: the moving robot and a base station. 
- The base station provides RTK corrections that allow the cooordiantes of the robot to be determined to 2 cm of accuracy.
- The moving robot dispenses fertilizer, and contains a container and enough capacity for 12 pounds of fertilizer.

**Base Station Components:** Battery, SparkFun GPS-RTK2 Board (ZED-F9P), GNSS Multi-Band L1/L2 Helical Antenna (SMA) BT-560, 1x HolyBro Telemetry Radio V3

**Moving Robot Components:** Battery, Raspberry Pi, 2 goBILDA Motors, 2 Servos, PVC Piping for Frame, SparkFun GPS-RTK2 Board (ZED-F9P), 1x HolyBro Telemetry Radio V3, GPS/GNSS Magnetic Mount Antenna - 3m (SMA)
